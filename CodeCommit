1) Create IAM user and give the full acess to codecommit Services 
  1.1) create credential 
    -> go to security credential 
    -> click on generate button on section  i.e - HTTPS Git credential for AWS CodeCommit
    -> Download or copy the credentail 
    
2) open CodeCommit  , create new repositories  ie myFirstRepo
3) Like Git,  there are two type of authentication available 1) HTTPS and 2) SSH
  3.1 By https authentication
    -> copied the link and ope ther gitbash or any terminal and use the following command 
    -> git clone  [past the copied https path) 
    -> now use th copied credential  here, that you got from 1.1 step 
    -> Now cloning is successfully done 
    -> now its same as git command , you can use the command like git add . , git  commit and git push further , git remote -v ,  git status  etc
       For more detail please follow my git tutorial 
    
   3.2 By SSH authentication 
     -> in developer machine open Git bash  then use the following commands 
        cd .ssh  
        ls 
        you can see default ssh keys id_rsa = private, id_rsa.pub = for public        
     ->Generate new key. The command is 
          ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "aws-code-commit"
          Enter the file in which to save the key : aws-code-commit
        Then press enter to generate the key file
      -> use the following command to see the files
          ls 
          aws-code-commit   aws-code-commit.pub
          cat aws-code-commit.pub         
        Now you just copy the content of  aws-code-commit-pub file
      -> now go to to IAM in aws and the go to securty crential and then upload the ssh public key in [SSH keys for aws codeCommit] section
      -> copy the ssh key ID 
      -> return to your developer machine and open git bash . make sure you are in .ssh directory where you previously create  the aw-code-commit files 
      -> create config file within .ssh folder enter the followin content within the config file 
         Host git.codecommit.*.amazonaws.com
           User FDFDFAFFD    <<means paste ssh key id here )
           IdentityFile ~/.ssh/aws-code-commit
      
      -> now do a quick test by following command 
        ssh git-codecommit.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com     <<for your case it may be different>>
      -> follow the same step as 3.1 , but here , you need to give the path from ssh option
